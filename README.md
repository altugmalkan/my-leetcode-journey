# 🚀 Daily LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my daily LeetCode challenge repository! Here, I will be sharing my solutions to various LeetCode problems as I strive to improve my coding skills and problem-solving abilities by solving at least one problem each day.

## 🎯 Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to:

- 📈 Track my progress in competitive programming.
- 🤝 Share my solutions and approaches with others.
- 🕰️ Stay consistent with daily coding practice.

## 🗂️ Structure

Each solution is stored in a separate folder with the format:

- **/[DayNumber]_[Problem-Name]_[Problem-ID]/**
  - `Solution.py` or `Program.cs` 
  - `README.md` (Description and approach)

## 💻 Language

I mainly use Python or C# for solving problems, but you may find solutions in other languages as well.

## 🌐 Let's Connect!

Feel free to fork, contribute, or reach out for discussions on any solution or alternative approaches. Let's learn and grow together in this coding journey!

**Happy Coding!** ✨
